## Customer Segmentation and Clustering Analysis
### Project Overview
This project involves analyzing eCommerce transactions to derive actionable insights through customer segmentation. The aim is to cluster customers based on their transaction and profile data, enabling better marketing strategies and personalized services.

### The tasks include:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gaining insights into customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends.
2. Lookalike Model: Recommending similar customers based on transactional and profile data.
3. Customer Segmentation: Grouping customers into meaningful clusters using clustering techniques.

### Technologies Used
1. Python: For data preprocessing, analysis, and clustering.
2. Pandas: For data manipulation and merging.
3. Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.
4. Scikit-Learn: For clustering and calculating metrics
